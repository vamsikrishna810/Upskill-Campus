## 2. Objectives

The main objectives of the Quiz Game Preparation project are as follows:

1. Create a user-friendly command-line interface for managing and playing quizzes.
2. Allow users to create new quizzes with custom questions and answers.
3. Implement a scoring system to track and display scores for each player.
4. Offer various quiz customization options, such as setting time limits and difficulty levels.
5. Store and retrieve quiz data efficiently using file handling.

## 3. Technologies Used

- Python 3.x: The core programming language used to develop the quiz game.
- File Handling: To save and load quiz data from text files.
- Libraries:
  - `random`: To shuffle questions and answer choices for a more engaging quiz experience.
